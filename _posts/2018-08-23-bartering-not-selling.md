**Zuckerberg Doesn't Tell Congress Facebook Barters Data**

In the world of semantics, bartering is not the same as selling. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/03/technology/facebook-device-partners-users-friends-data.html

In the same news, Zuckie lied to Congress and to the public about users owning and having control of their data, saying: "Every piece of content that you share on Facebook you own. You have complete control over who sees it and how you share it." https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/06/05/facebook-defends-practice-of-giving-deep-data-access-to-device-makers/

From the NYTimes article:
<blockquote>
Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users’ friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users’ friends who believed they had barred any sharing
