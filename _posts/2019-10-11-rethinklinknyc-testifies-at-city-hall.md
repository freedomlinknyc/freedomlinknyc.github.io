**From retailers to landlords, cops to kiosks**

Alongside several other community groups, ReThinkLink.nyc testified
Monday, October 12 2019 at City Council's hearing on banning facial
recognition.  Here's what we said!

This was our testimony:

Good afternoon council.

My name is Schuyler Duveen, representing a community group called
RethinkLink.nyc.
I've worked in the technology industry for 25 years seeing many
different faces of privacy violations
and the evolution into our current beyond-Orwellian state.
First as a hacker in my sophomoric high-school days, then dealing in
educational and security aspects at schools,
I was also Director of Technology at WNYC radio for four years.

I first want to celebrate two aspects of this bill that you should
preserve with future legislation:
First, you avoided the narrow framing of "facial recognition" and
discuss biometric recognition in general.
   This is important since the industry often retreats to narrowly
excluding 'facial recognition' while this
   is among many forms of recognition, and not even the most reliable,
among others are 'gait recognition' 
   'voice recognition' 'smell recognition' and a recent patent filed
outlines 'butt recognition'

Second, you avoid the framing of markers that immediately are connected
to individuals and you define the technology
  around what is *capable* of identifying a person.  Many times, the
local company/'collector' will not know the person, but can
  collect markers and then pass it to other companies which do matching
without any transparency that it's happening at all.
  The local organization can confidently say "We don't identify
individuals" all the while passing biometric data to 3rd parties
  and targeting them or profiling them in other ways.

I'm here to request that you pass this legislation and pass further
legislation that is more aggressive in the following ways:

One, that you expand identifying technology to consumer-products and
objects (like key fobs) 
  that have not been established with local permission on premises.  

  Our personal phones are tracked with WiFi and BlueTooth technology in
all sorts of public spaces.

  RFIDs are embedded in retail items to track during shipping -- from
clothing to children's toys.
  However, they mostly stay on beyond purchase and can often track your
person while navigating public spaces carrying these items.

Secondly, that you expand the law to new york city 'furniture' -- i.e.
Link.NYC kiosks.

One organization that has committed both sins above is Sidewalk labs in
partnership with DoITT.  Their current "privacy policy"
(if you could call it such a thing) excludes "facial recognition" but
doesn't say they are avoiding any other biometric markers
as we walk down the street.  As an example, while the privacy policy
says much about how they collect video (they shouldn't be recording
video at all) -- they include 'audio' as "ambient noise" in a category
which they can share indiscriminantly with any third parties and
store indefinitely.

New Yorkers should be secure in our public space and we, the people,
should set the terms for our identity being tracked rather
than let the companies write their own loop-holes.

====

One last thing I wanted to discuss is a question that the council has
asked other folks testifying today.  
Besides possible the harms brought up thus far, 

Credit Scores, Loan Approvals (and advertisements for opportunities)
have been based on who your facebook friends are
 -- these can be statistical and if collection occurs, the statistical
nature allows companies to lie about how connected
 these factors are -- maybe it's where I walked down the street -- or
who I walked down the street with, or who visited me 
 in my apartment.  We shouldn't wait until it becomes public that this
was done.
