**Kiosks go up in Glasgow Scotland**

[Cian Heasley interviews RethinkLinkNYC](https://medium.com/@nscrutables/an-interview-with-rethinklinknyc-on-tech-privacy-the-future-of-smart-cities-8bfe4a987876) about LinkNYC and the kiosks in New York City. In his article, he mentions that physically identical kiosks have gone up in Glasgow, a place close to his home.

Fortunately, the citizens there have been able to get InLinkUK, the company constructing the kiosks, to disable the 2 side cameras.
